All commands issued, along with the output generated is logged to a file. Log files, along with the command history for the REPL live in the directory located at `~/.objection`. If this directory does not exist, `objection` will create it.

The `objection` log file can be located at:
```
~/.objection/objection.log
```

The `objection` command history file can be located at:
```
~/.objection/objection_history
```

Deleting the `~/.objection` directory should be safe to do and will be recreated the next time `objection` starts up.
