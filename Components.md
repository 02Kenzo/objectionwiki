`objection` is made up of two primary components.

The first component is the [Frida Gadget](https://www.frida.re/) that starts up with a patched mobile application. Frida is responsible for most of the _magic_ under the hood, running the hooks provided by `objection` and making this tool possible in the first place.

The second being the `objection` tool itself. This is a `python` software component that provides the `objection` command. It is responsible for interacting with a loaded Frida Gadget, running hooks and parsing the output generated by those.
