This article will walk through some sample usage of `objection`. A few assumptions are made:

* It is assumed that you have successfully followed the [installation](installation) guide and have the `objection` command available in your `PATH`. 
* It is also assumed that you have a successfully patched an unencrypted IPA, or added the FridaGadget to your project and deployed it to a device.

## command format
The `objection` command contains a number of subcommands. Certain subcommands may contain flags to set various configurations and options. To get a list of available options, run any `objection` command with the `--help` flag. For example:

```bash
$ objection --help
Usage: objection [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  By default, communications will happen over USB, unless the --network
  option is provided.

Options:
  -N, --network       Connect using a network connection instead of USB.
                      [default: False]
  -h, --host TEXT     [default: 127.0.0.1]
  -p, --port INTEGER  [default: 27042]
  -g, --gadget TEXT   Name of the Frida Gadget/Process to connect to.
                      [default: Gadget]
  --help              Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  device_type  Get information about an attached device.
  explore      Start the objection exploration REPL.
  patchipa     Patch an IPA with the FridaGadget dylib.
  version      Prints the current version and exists
```

The most commonly used subcommand is `explore`, which will start the `objection` exploration REPL. Considering the options in the above `--help` output, to connect to a Frida gadget hosted on the network, one would execute `objection -N explore`.

The exploration REPL will autocomplete commands when the `[TAB]` key is pressed whenever possible. If you need some help, prefixing your full command with the `help` keyword will print documentation and usage examples for the command in question:

```
skdw on (iPhone: 10.3.1) [net] # help ios hooking dump method_args
Command: ios hooking dump method_args

Usage: ios hooking dump method_args <+/-> <class_name> <method_name>

Dumps method invocations in real time, including the arguments used at the
time. This command tries its best to convert the arguments themselves into
readable data, but sometimes the pointers used are to data structures not
easily converted to readable formats.

When issuing this command, a few bits of information is needed to build up
the full class that should be hooked. The needed information includes:
   - A '+' or '-' indicating a class or instance method
   - The ClassName in question
   - The method name *including* the argument separators (':')

All of the information you need can be sourced with the `ios hooking list *`
commands, or using the 'class-dump' tool.

Examples:
   ios hooking dump method_args + KeychainDataManager find:
   ios hooking dump method_args - PinnedNSURLSessionStarwarsApi getJsonResponseFrom:onSuccess:onFailure:

## getting started (ios edition)
With a patched IPA installed to your iOS device and with the device connected to your computer via USB, the `objection` REPL may be started with the `objection explore` command:

```bash
$ objection explore

     _     _         _   _

| . | . | | | -_|  _|  _| | . |   |
