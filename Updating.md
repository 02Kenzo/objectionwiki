`objection` is packaged using pypi. Therefore, updating `objection` is really easy. Simply issue the following command to get the latest version!

```
pip3 install objection --upgrade
```

To get the currently installed version, run `objection version`:

```bash
$ objection version
objection: 1.0.2
```

That's it! ðŸ’¥
