`objection` is packaged using pypi. Therefore, updating `objection` is really easy. Simply issue the following command to get the latest version:

```
pip3 install objection --upgrade
```

Since version [1.1.9](https://github.com/sensepost/objection/releases/tag/1.1.9), objection will automatically check for updated versions on Github.  

To get the currently installed version, run `objection version`:

```bash
$ objection version
objection: 1.1.10
```

That's it! ðŸ’¥
